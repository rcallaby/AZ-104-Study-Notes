# Implement Backup and Recovery

As cloud computing continues to grow in popularity, organizations have started to migrate their services and applications to the cloud. However, this move comes with certain challenges, such as the need to ensure that data is secure and always available. This is where backup and recovery come in.

In the Azure cloud, there are several ways to implement backup and recovery, depending on the type of data or service being backed up. In this article, we will discuss the various options available and how to implement them.

## Azure Backup

Azure Backup is a service that provides data protection solutions for Azure services and on-premises servers. Azure Backup allows you to back up and restore your data to and from the cloud.

To implement Azure Backup, follow these steps:

+ Step 1: Create a Recovery Services Vault

A Recovery Services Vault is a container that stores backup data for Azure services and on-premises servers. To create a Recovery Services Vault, follow these steps:

a. In the Azure portal, click on 'Create a resource'.
b. In the search bar, type 'Recovery Services Vault' and select the option.
c. Fill in the required details such as the subscription, resource group, and name of the Recovery Services Vault.

+ Step 2: Create a Backup Policy

A Backup Policy is a set of rules that define when and how often to back up data. To create a Backup Policy, follow these steps:

a. In the Recovery Services Vault, select 'Backup Policies'.
b. Click on 'Add' to create a new policy.
c. Fill in the required details such as the backup frequency, retention period, and the data to be backed up.

+ Step 3: Configure Backup

After creating a Recovery Services Vault and a Backup Policy, you can now configure backup for your services and servers. To configure backup, follow these steps:

a. In the Recovery Services Vault, select 'Backup Items'.
b. Click on 'Add Backup' to add a new backup item.
c. Choose the type of service or server you want to back up, and follow the prompts to complete the configuration.

## Azure Site Recovery

Azure Site Recovery is a service that provides disaster recovery solutions for Azure services and on-premises servers. Azure Site Recovery allows you to replicate your data to a secondary location and failover to that location in the event of a disaster.

To implement Azure Site Recovery, follow these steps:

+ Step 1: Create a Recovery Services Vault

As mentioned earlier, a Recovery Services Vault is a container that stores backup data. To create a Recovery Services Vault, follow the same steps as outlined in Step 1 of Azure Backup.

+ Step 2: Create a Site Recovery Vault

A Site Recovery Vault is a container that stores replication data for Azure services and on-premises servers. To create a Site Recovery Vault, follow these steps:

a. In the Recovery Services Vault, select 'Site Recovery'.
b. Click on 'Create a Site Recovery Vault'.
c. Fill in the required details such as the subscription, resource group, and name of the Site Recovery Vault.

+ Step 3: Configure Replication

After creating a Recovery Services Vault and a Site Recovery Vault, you can now configure replication for your services and servers. To configure replication, follow these steps:

a. In the Site Recovery Vault, select 'Replication and failover'.
b. Click on 'Step 1: Replicate Application'.
c. Choose the type of service or server you want to replicate, and follow the prompts to complete the configuration.

### Azure SQL Database Backup

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed cloud database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security. Azure SQL Database Backup allows you to back up your database to the cloud.

To implement Azure SQL Database Backup, follow these steps:

+ Step 1: Create a Storage Account

A Storage Account is a container that stores backup data for Azure SQL Database. To create a Storage Account, follow these steps:

a. In the Azure portal, click on 'Create a resource'.
b. In the search bar, type 'Storage Account' and select the option.
c. Fill in the required details such as the subscription, resource group, and name of the Storage Account.

+ Step 2: Configure Backup

After creating a Storage Account, you can now configure backup for your Azure SQL Database. To configure backup, follow these steps:

a. In the Azure SQL Database, select 'Automated backups'.
b. Click on 'Configure'.
c. Choose the Storage Account you created earlier and configure the retention period.

+ Step 3: Restore from Backup

In the event of data loss or corruption, you can restore your Azure SQL Database from a backup. To restore from backup, follow these steps:

a. In the Azure SQL Database, select 'Restore'.
b. Choose the backup file you want to restore from and configure the restore settings.

# Conclusion

Implementing backup and recovery in Azure Cloud Services is an essential part of ensuring the availability and security of your data. Azure provides several options for backup and recovery, such as Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and Azure SQL Database Backup. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can implement backup and recovery for your Azure services and servers and be prepared for any disaster that may occur.
