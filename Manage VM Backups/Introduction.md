# Manage VM Backups

What is Azure VM Backup?
Azure VM backup is a service that enables you to back up and restore VMs running in Azure. VM backups can be used to protect against accidental deletion, data corruption, and hardware failure. You can configure VM backups to take regular snapshots of your VMs, which can be used to restore the VM to a previous state in case of any issues.

Azure VM Backup Types
Azure VM backups can be of two types:

Full backup
Incremental backup
A full backup takes a snapshot of the entire VM, while an incremental backup takes a snapshot of only the changes made since the last backup. This means that incremental backups are much faster and require less storage than full backups.

Azure VM Backup Components
Azure VM backups consist of the following components:

Backup policy: A backup policy is a set of rules that determine when and how often backups are taken. You can create a backup policy and associate it with one or more VMs.

Recovery Services Vault: A recovery services vault is a container that stores backup data for all the VMs associated with a backup policy. You can create a recovery services vault in the same region as your VMs.

Backup agent: A backup agent is a lightweight software that runs on the VM and takes the backups. The backup agent communicates with the recovery services vault to store the backup data.

Azure VM Backup Management
Managing Azure VM backups involves the following steps:

Step 1: Create a Recovery Services Vault
The first step in managing VM backups is to create a recovery services vault. You can create a recovery services vault in the same region as your VMs. To create a recovery services vault, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, click on Create a resource.
Search for Recovery Services Vault and click on Create.
Enter the required details such as name, subscription, and resource group.
Select the region where you want to create the vault.
Click on Review + Create and then click on Create.
Step 2: Create a Backup Policy
Once you have created a recovery services vault, the next step is to create a backup policy. A backup policy determines when and how often backups are taken. To create a backup policy, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, go to the Recovery Services Vault you created in step 1.
Click on Backup policies and then click on Add.
Enter the required details such as name, retention period, and backup frequency.
Click on OK to create the backup policy.
Step 3: Associate the Backup Policy with VMs
After creating a backup policy, the next step is to associate the backup policy with the VMs that you want to back up. To associate the backup policy with VMs, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, go to the Recovery Services Vault you created in step 1.
Click on Backup items and then click on Add.
Select Virtual Machine as the backup type and then select the VM that you want to back up.
Select the backup policy that you created in step 2.
Click on OK to associate the backup policy with the VM.

Step 4: Test the Backup and Restore Process
After associating the backup policy with VMs, the next step is to test the backup and restore process. Testing the backup and restore process ensures that the backups are working correctly and can be used to restore the VM to a previous state if required. To test the backup and restore process, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, go to the Recovery Services Vault you created in step 1.
Click on Backup items and then select the VM that you want to test.
Click on Backup now to initiate a backup of the VM.
Once the backup is complete, go to the Recovery Services Vault and click on Backup jobs.
Verify that the backup job completed successfully.
To test the restore process, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, go to the Recovery Services Vault you created in step 1.
Click on Backup items and then select the VM that you want to restore.
Click on Restore VM.
Select the restore point that you want to use and then click on OK.
Follow the prompts to restore the VM to the selected restore point.
Step 5: Monitor and Manage Backups
The final step in managing Azure VM backups is to monitor and manage backups. You can monitor backups to ensure that they are working correctly and take action if required. To monitor and manage backups, follow these steps:

In the Azure portal, go to the Recovery Services Vault you created in step 1.
Click on Backup items to view the VMs associated with the backup policy.
Click on Backup jobs to view the status of the backup jobs.
Click on Alerts to configure alerts for backup-related events such as failed backups.
Click on Backup policy to modify the backup policy if required.
Conclusion
Azure VM backups are an essential aspect of data protection in the cloud. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can manage VM backups in Azure and ensure that your data and applications are protected against accidental deletion, data corruption, and hardware failure. Understanding how to manage VM backups in Azure is a critical skill for the AZ-104 exam and is essential for any organization running workloads in Azure.
