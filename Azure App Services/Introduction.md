# Azure App Services

Azure App Service is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering provided by Microsoft Azure that allows developers to easily build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs. It's one of the core services you need to learn if you're preparing for the AZ-104 exam, which is the Microsoft Azure Administrator certification.

## Features of Azure App Service
Azure App Service provides a wide range of features that make it easy to build and deploy web applications and APIs. Here are some of the most important features you need to know:

### Web Apps
Azure App Service allows you to deploy web applications in a variety of languages, including .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. It also supports popular web frameworks such as Django, Express, Flask, and Rails.

### Mobile Apps
Azure App Service also supports mobile app development, allowing you to build and deploy cross-platform mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using Xamarin or Apache Cordova.

### API Apps
If you're building APIs, Azure App Service makes it easy to deploy and manage them. You can use a wide range of languages and frameworks, including .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

### Logic Apps
Azure Logic Apps allows you to build and automate workflows that integrate with other Azure services or external services such as Office 365, Salesforce, and Dropbox.

### Function Apps
Azure Function Apps allows you to build and deploy serverless functions that can be triggered by events such as changes to data in Azure Blob Storage, Azure Queue Storage, or Azure Event Grid.

### Easy Deployment
Azure App Service makes it easy to deploy your web applications and APIs using a variety of deployment options, including Git, FTP, or Visual Studio Team Services.

### Scale and Performance
Azure App Service provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and traffic management to ensure your web applications and APIs perform well under heavy load.

## Pricing of Azure App Service
Azure App Service offers several pricing tiers that allow you to choose the right level of resources for your application. Here are the most important pricing tiers:

### Free Tier
The Free Tier allows you to host up to 10 web, mobile, or API apps with 1 GB of storage and 165 MB of memory per instance. This tier is great for small-scale testing or development.

### Shared Tier
The Shared Tier allows you to host up to 100 web, mobile, or API apps with 1 GB of storage and 60 minutes of CPU time per day per app. This tier is suitable for small-scale production workloads.

### Basic Tier
The Basic Tier offers dedicated resources, allowing you to host up to 6 web, mobile, or API apps with 10 GB of storage and 1.75 GB of memory per instance. This tier is suitable for production workloads with low to moderate traffic.

### Standard Tier
The Standard Tier offers more resources than the Basic Tier, allowing you to host up to 10 web, mobile, or API apps with 50 GB of storage and 3.5 GB of memory per instance. This tier is suitable for production workloads with moderate to high traffic.

### Premium Tier
The Premium Tier offers the highest level of resources, allowing you to host up to 30 web, mobile, or API apps with 250 GB of storage and 14 GB of memory per instance. This tier is suitable for production workloads with high traffic and high availability requirements.

## Deployment Options for Azure App Service
Azure App Service provides a variety of deployment options to suit your needs. Here are the most important

### Git Deployment
Git deployment is the easiest way to deploy your web application or API to Azure App Service. With Git deployment, you simply push your code to a Git repository hosted in Azure, and Azure will automatically build and deploy your application.

### FTP Deployment
FTP deployment allows you to deploy your web application or API using an FTP client such as FileZilla. This option is suitable if you need to deploy your application to a non-Windows platform or if you prefer to deploy your application manually.

### Visual Studio Team Services
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) allows you to deploy your web application or API using Microsoft's cloud-based DevOps platform. With VSTS, you can build, test, and deploy your application using a variety of tools and services.

### Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is a cloud-based DevOps platform that provides a suite of tools for building, testing, and deploying applications. With Azure DevOps, you can automate your deployment pipeline and ensure your application is deployed quickly and reliably.

## Important Concepts for the AZ-104 Exam
If you're preparing for the AZ-104 exam, you need to understand some important concepts related to Azure App Service. Here are the most important concepts:

## App Service Plans
An App Service Plan is a set of compute resources that are dedicated to your Azure App Service application. App Service Plans define the number of virtual machines, the amount of memory, and the CPU resources allocated to your application.

### Scaling
Scaling allows you to adjust the resources allocated to your Azure App Service application based on demand. You can scale your application vertically (by adding more resources to an existing virtual machine) or horizontally (by adding more virtual machines to your App Service Plan).

### Deployment Slots
Deployment Slots allow you to deploy and test your application in a separate environment before deploying it to production. Deployment Slots allow you to test your application with real data without affecting your production environment.

### Azure App Service Environment
An Azure App Service Environment (ASE) is a fully isolated and dedicated environment for hosting Azure App Service applications. ASEs are designed for high-scale enterprise applications that require dedicated resources and a high level of security.

# Conclusion
Azure App Service is a powerful Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to easily build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs. In this article, we covered the most important features of Azure App Service, its pricing tiers, deployment options, and important concepts related to the AZ-104 exam. By understanding these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to deploy and manage Azure App Service applications in a production environment.
