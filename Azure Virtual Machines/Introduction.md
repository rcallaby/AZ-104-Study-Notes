# Azure Virtual Machines

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are a popular Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering in Azure, which allows users to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud. Azure VMs are used for a wide range of purposes, including testing and development, hosting web applications, running databases, and more.

As someone studying for the AZ-104 exam, it's important to understand the fundamentals of Azure VMs, including how to create, configure, and manage them. Here are some key things to keep in mind:

### Creating an Azure VM
To create an Azure VM, you will need to go through a few steps. First, you will need to select the virtual machine image that you want to use. Azure offers a wide range of pre-built images that you can use, including images for Windows and Linux. Once you have selected the image, you will need to choose the size of the VM and configure its settings, including its storage options, network settings, and more.

### Configuring Azure VMs
Once you have created an Azure VM, you will need to configure it to meet your specific needs. This may include setting up remote desktop access, configuring network settings, installing software, and more. One important thing to keep in mind is that Azure VMs can be expensive, so it's important to optimize your configuration to minimize costs while still meeting your needs.

### Managing Azure VMs
Managing Azure VMs involves a wide range of tasks, including monitoring performance, scaling resources up or down, patching and updating software, and more. Azure offers a range of tools to help you manage your VMs, including Azure Monitor, Azure Resource Manager, and more. These tools can help you keep your VMs running smoothly and efficiently.

### Availability Sets and Fault Tolerance
To ensure that your Azure VMs are always available, even in the event of hardware failures, it's important to use availability sets. An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that are deployed across different physical hardware, ensuring that if one piece of hardware fails, your VMs will still be available. You can also use fault tolerance features like Azure Site Recovery to replicate VMs across different regions, further reducing the risk of downtime.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
Finally, it's important to have a solid backup and disaster recovery plan in place for your Azure VMs. This may involve backing up your VMs to Azure Storage, setting up disaster recovery to a different region, or using third-party backup solutions. Whatever approach you choose, it's important to test your backup and disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure that you can recover quickly in the event of an outage.

In conclusion, Azure Virtual Machines are a powerful and flexible IaaS offering that can be used for a wide range of purposes. As someone studying for the AZ-104 exam, it's important to understand how to create, configure, and manage Azure VMs, as well as how to optimize them for performance and cost. By mastering these fundamentals, you will be well-prepared to use Azure VMs to meet your organization's needs.
