# Monitor Resources Using Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a powerful tool used for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data generated by various Azure services. It is a critical component of the Azure ecosystem, and therefore it is essential to have a good understanding of its capabilities for the AZ-104 exam. In this article, we will explore how to use Azure Monitor to monitor resources in Azure.

## What is Azure Monitor?

Azure Monitor is a fully managed service that provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for Azure resources. It allows you to collect telemetry data from various sources, such as Azure resources, applications, and infrastructure, and provides you with insights into the performance, availability, and health of your Azure environment.

Azure Monitor provides a range of features to help you monitor your resources, including metrics, logs, alerts, and dashboards. Each of these features provides a different way of collecting and analyzing data, allowing you to gain insights into your environment at different levels.

## Metrics

Metrics are numerical values that provide information about the performance and health of your Azure resources. Azure Monitor collects metrics from various Azure services, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and Azure SQL databases, and displays them in a tabular format.

To view metrics in Azure Monitor, you need to navigate to the Metrics blade of the resource you want to monitor. Here, you can select the metric you want to view, such as CPU utilization or memory usage, and set the time range for which you want to see the data. You can also use Azure Monitor to create alerts based on specific metric thresholds, allowing you to receive notifications when a resource exceeds a particular performance threshold.

## Logs

Logs are textual data that provide information about the operations and events that occur within your Azure environment. Azure Monitor collects logs from various sources, such as Azure resources, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Security Center, and displays them in a centralized location.

To view logs in Azure Monitor, you need to navigate to the Logs blade of the resource you want to monitor. Here, you can run queries against the log data to gain insights into the operations and events occurring within your Azure environment. You can also use Azure Monitor to create alerts based on specific log queries, allowing you to receive notifications when specific events occur within your environment.

## Alerts

Alerts are notifications that are triggered when specific conditions are met within your Azure environment. Azure Monitor provides a range of alert types, such as metric alerts, log alerts, and activity log alerts, allowing you to monitor your resources at different levels.

To create an alert in Azure Monitor, you need to define the condition that will trigger the alert, such as a particular metric threshold or a specific log query. You also need to define the action that will be taken when the alert is triggered, such as sending an email notification or triggering an Azure Function.

## Dashboards

Dashboards are customizable views that provide a summary of the performance and health of your Azure environment. Azure Monitor allows you to create dashboards using various data sources, such as metrics, logs, and application insights.

To create a dashboard in Azure Monitor, you need to select the data sources you want to display and configure the layout and visualization options. You can also share dashboards with other users within your Azure environment, allowing you to collaborate on monitoring and troubleshooting activities.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Azure Monitor is a powerful tool that provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for Azure resources. It allows you to collect telemetry data from various sources and gain insights into the performance, availability, and health of your Azure environment. Understanding how to use Azure Monitor is essential for the AZ-104 exam, as it is a critical component of the Azure ecosystem. By mastering Azure Monitor, you will be able to monitor your resources effectively, troubleshoot issues quickly, and optimize the performance of your Azure environment.
