# Azure Concepts

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services and tools to help organizations build, deploy, and manage applications and infrastructure. For those preparing to take the AZ-104 exam, it is important to have a good understanding of the core Azure concepts. In this article, we will provide an overview of Azure concepts that are likely to be covered in the exam.

## Azure Regions and Availability Zones
Azure Regions are geographical locations where Azure resources are deployed. Each region consists of one or more data centers that are located within a specific geographic area. Azure regions are used to provide customers with low-latency access to Azure services and to ensure data sovereignty and compliance with local regulations.

Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region that are connected by high-speed, low-latency networks. Availability Zones provide customers with increased availability and fault tolerance by replicating services across multiple data centers.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure resources. ARM allows you to create, update, and delete Azure resources as a group, instead of managing them individually. ARM provides a consistent management layer for all Azure resources, regardless of their type, and enables you to define dependencies between resources.

ARM templates are used to automate the deployment of Azure resources. ARM templates are JSON files that define the resources to be deployed and their configuration.

### Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are virtualized compute resources that are hosted in Azure data centers. Azure VMs can run a variety of operating systems, including Windows and Linux, and can be customized to meet specific requirements.

VM sizes are defined by the number of virtual CPUs, memory, and temporary storage. Azure VMs can be provisioned in a variety of configurations, including single instances, availability sets, and virtual machine scale sets.

### Azure Storage
Azure Storage is a cloud-based storage service that provides highly available and durable storage for applications and data. Azure Storage provides a range of storage options, including Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and File storage.

Blob storage is used to store unstructured data, such as images, videos, and documents. Table storage is used to store structured data, such as tables with rows and columns. Queue storage is used to store messages that are processed asynchronously by applications. File storage is used to store and share files over the network using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

### Azure Networking
Azure Networking provides a range of services for connecting and securing Azure resources. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a logical isolation of Azure resources that allows you to control network traffic and IP address space. Azure Load Balancer is a service that distributes incoming traffic among multiple virtual machines to increase availability and scalability. Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that provides application-level routing and load balancing. Azure VPN Gateway is a service that provides secure connectivity between on-premises and Azure resources.

### Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides authentication and authorization for Azure resources. Azure AD provides a range of features, including user and group management, single sign-on, and multi-factor authentication. Azure AD also provides integration with other cloud services, such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365.

### Azure Governance
Azure Governance provides a range of services for managing and controlling Azure resources. Azure Policy is a service that allows you to create, assign, and manage policies to enforce compliance and governance. Azure Management Groups allow you to organize Azure resources into hierarchies for easier management and control. Azure Blueprints allow you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that can be deployed together as a package.

To pass the AZ-104 exam, it is important to have a good understanding of these concepts, as well as their use cases and how they can be configured and managed in Azure. In addition, it is important to have hands-on experience with Azure, as the exam will test your ability to implement and manage Azure services and solutions.

Microsoft offers a range of resources to help you prepare for the AZ-104 exam, including official documentation, training courses, and practice exams. It is also recommended that you have a good understanding of cloud computing concepts and principles, as well as experience with other cloud platforms and services.

In summary, Azure is a powerful and flexible cloud platform that offers a wide range of services and tools for building, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure. Understanding the core Azure concepts and how to use them effectively is essential for anyone preparing to take the AZ-104 exam and for those who want to build and manage solutions on Azure.
