# Manage Subscriptions and Governance

In Azure, a subscription is a logical container that holds a set of Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases. Each subscription is associated with a billing account, and there can be multiple subscriptions associated with a single billing account. Subscriptions are typically used to organize resources by project, department, or environment, such as development, staging, and production.

When creating a subscription, you will need to choose a pricing tier, which determines the maximum amount of resources you can use and the associated cost. There are several pricing tiers available, including Free, Pay-As-You-Go, and Enterprise Agreement.

To manage subscriptions in Azure, you can use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. In the Azure portal, you can view information about your subscriptions, such as usage and cost, and manage subscription settings, such as billing and access control.

## Governance in Azure

Governance in Azure refers to the processes and policies used to manage and control access to resources in Azure. This includes defining roles and permissions, monitoring resource usage, and enforcing compliance with regulatory and security standards.

To implement governance in Azure, you can use Azure Policy, Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Azure Management Groups. Azure Policy allows you to define and enforce policies that govern the configuration of resources in Azure, such as requiring the use of specific virtual machine sizes or enforcing the use of certain storage account types. Azure RBAC allows you to assign roles to users and groups, such as Owner, Contributor, or Reader, to control access to resources in Azure. Azure Management Groups allows you to group subscriptions together and apply policies and RBAC assignments to them at the group level.

## Best Practices for Managing Subscriptions and Governance in Azure

To effectively manage subscriptions and governance in Azure, it is important to follow best practices. Here are some key best practices to keep in mind when working with Azure subscriptions and governance:

+ Use a naming convention: Use a consistent naming convention for subscriptions, resource groups, and resources to make it easier to manage and identify resources.

+ Implement RBAC: Use Azure RBAC to control access to resources in Azure and assign roles based on job functions and responsibilities.

+ Use Azure Policy: Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance with regulatory and security standards and to ensure consistency in resource configurations.

+ Monitor resource usage: Monitor resource usage to identify potential issues, such as overprovisioning or underutilization of resources, and optimize resource usage to minimize costs.

+ Use Azure Management Groups: Use Azure Management Groups to organize subscriptions and apply policies and RBAC assignments at the group level.

+ Review and audit resource configurations: Regularly review and audit resource configurations to ensure compliance with policies and best practices.

+ Use automation: Use automation, such as Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI, to simplify management tasks and ensure consistency in resource configurations.
