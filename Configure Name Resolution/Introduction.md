# Configure Name Resolution

Name resolution is an essential aspect of any cloud service. In Azure, there are different ways to configure name resolution, including DNS resolution, host name resolution, and IP address resolution. In this article, we will explore how to configure name resolution in Azure cloud services from the perspective of someone taking the AZ-104 exam.

Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution

DNS resolution is a process of converting domain names into IP addresses. It is an essential component of any network infrastructure, including cloud services. DNS resolution in Azure can be achieved using Azure DNS, which is a fully-managed DNS service that provides high availability, scalability, and security for domain name resolution.

To configure DNS resolution in Azure, follow these steps:

Create an Azure DNS zone: An Azure DNS zone is a container for DNS records that map domain names to IP addresses. To create a DNS zone, go to the Azure portal and click on the "+ Create a resource" button. Search for "DNS zone" and click on "Create."

Configure DNS records: After creating a DNS zone, configure DNS records to map domain names to IP addresses. To do this, click on the DNS zone you just created, and then click on "Add record set." Enter the domain name, IP address, and other required details. Click on "Add" to create the record set.

Update virtual machines: After configuring DNS records, update the virtual machines in the Azure environment to use the Azure DNS server for name resolution. To do this, open the virtual machine settings and click on the "Networking" tab. Select the virtual network, and then select "Custom DNS" under DNS servers. Enter the IP address of the Azure DNS server and click on "Save."

Test DNS resolution: To test DNS resolution, ping the domain name and ensure that the IP address matches the one configured in the DNS record.

Hostname Resolution

Hostname resolution is a process of mapping hostnames to IP addresses. In Azure, hostname resolution can be achieved using Azure Private DNS, which is a DNS service that provides name resolution for virtual machines within an Azure virtual network.

To configure hostname resolution in Azure, follow these steps:

Create a Private DNS zone: A Private DNS zone is a DNS zone that provides name resolution for virtual machines within an Azure virtual network. To create a Private DNS zone, go to the Azure portal and click on the "+ Create a resource" button. Search for "Private DNS zone" and click on "Create."

Configure DNS records: After creating a Private DNS zone, configure DNS records to map hostnames to IP addresses. To do this, click on the Private DNS zone you just created, and then click on "Add record set." Enter the hostname, IP address, and other required details. Click on "Add" to create the record set.

Update virtual machines: After configuring DNS records, update the virtual machines in the Azure environment to use the Azure Private DNS server for name resolution. To do this, open the virtual machine settings and click on the "Networking" tab. Select the virtual network, and then select "Custom DNS" under DNS servers. Enter the IP address of the Azure Private DNS server and click on "Save."

Test hostname resolution: To test hostname resolution, ping the hostname and ensure that the IP address matches the one configured in the DNS record.

IP Address Resolution

IP address resolution is a process of mapping IP addresses to hostnames. In Azure, IP address resolution can be achieved using Azure DNS reverse lookup, which is a DNS service that provides name resolution for IP addresses within an Azure virtual network.

To configure IP address resolution in Azure, follow these steps:

Create a DNS reverse lookup zone: A DNS reverse lookup zone is a DNS zone that provides name resolution for IP addresses within an Azure virtual network. To create a DNS reverse lookup zone, go to the Azure portal and click on the "+ Create a resource" button. Search for "DNS zone" and click on "Create."

Configure reverse DNS records: After creating a DNS reverse lookup zone, configure reverse DNS records to map IP addresses to hostnames. To do this, click on the DNS reverse lookup zone you just created, and then click on "Add record set." Enter the IP address, hostname, and other required details. Click on "Add" to create the record set.

Update virtual machines: After configuring reverse DNS records, update the virtual machines in the Azure environment to use the Azure DNS reverse lookup server for IP address resolution. To do this, open the virtual machine settings and click on the "Networking" tab. Select the virtual network, and then select "Custom DNS" under DNS servers. Enter the IP address of the Azure DNS reverse lookup server and click on "Save."

Test IP address resolution: To test IP address resolution, use the nslookup command to query the reverse lookup zone and ensure that the hostname matches the one configured in the DNS record.

Conclusion

In summary, configuring name resolution in Azure cloud services is essential for efficient and reliable communication between virtual machines and other network resources. Azure provides several options for name resolution, including DNS resolution, hostname resolution, and IP address resolution. Configuring name resolution in Azure involves creating DNS zones, configuring DNS records, and updating virtual machine settings to use the appropriate DNS servers. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can confidently configure name resolution in Azure for the AZ-104 exam.
