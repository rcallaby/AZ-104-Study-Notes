# Manage Azure VM

## Creating Azure VMs
To create an Azure VM, you must first select a virtual machine image. The image contains the operating system, along with any pre-installed software and configurations. Azure provides a wide range of pre-built images, including both Windows and Linux operating systems, and images that are optimized for specific applications.

After selecting an image, you can then choose the VM size, which determines the CPU, memory, and storage capacity of the VM. Azure offers a variety of VM sizes, ranging from small, low-cost VMs to large, high-performance VMs.

You will also need to specify the virtual network and subnet that the VM will be deployed in, as well as the storage account that will be used to store the VM's disks.

## Managing Azure VMs
Once you have created an Azure VM, you can manage it using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Azure API.

### Managing VMs with the Azure portal
The Azure portal provides a graphical user interface that enables you to manage your VMs. You can perform a wide range of tasks, including starting and stopping VMs, managing disks and networking, configuring monitoring and diagnostics, and setting up backup and recovery.

### Managing VMs with Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell is a command-line interface that enables you to manage your VMs using PowerShell commands. You can perform the same tasks as with the Azure portal, but with the added flexibility and automation of PowerShell scripting.

### Managing VMs with Azure CLI
Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line interface that enables you to manage your VMs using shell commands. Like Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI provides the flexibility and automation of scripting, but with a different syntax and workflow.

### Managing VMs with the Azure API
The Azure API is a set of REST APIs that enables you to manage your VMs programmatically. You can use any programming language that supports HTTP requests to interact with the API and perform tasks such as creating and deleting VMs, resizing VMs, and configuring networking.

### Scaling Azure VMs
Azure VMs can be scaled up or down to meet changing demands. Scaling can be done manually or automatically, depending on your requirements.

### Manual scaling
Manual scaling involves changing the VM size to increase or decrease its CPU, memory, and storage capacity. This can be done using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

### Automatic scaling
Automatic scaling involves setting up rules that automatically adjust the VM size based on resource utilization or application performance. This can be done using Azure Automation, Azure Logic Apps, or other Azure services that support automated scaling.

### Managing Azure VM availability
Azure VMs can be configured to provide high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that your applications remain available even in the event of hardware or software failures.

### Availability sets
Availability sets are a feature of Azure that enables you to group VMs together into a set that shares a common underlying physical infrastructure. This ensures that VMs in the set are not all affected by the same hardware or software failures, and that at least one VM remains available at all times.

### Azure Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple VMs, ensuring that the workload is evenly balanced and that individual VMs are not overloaded.

### Azure Application Gateway
Azure Application Gateway is a service that provides application-level load balancing and routing, enabling you to control and optimize traffic to your applications. It can be used to distribute traffic across multiple VMs, providing redundancy and high availability.

### Azure Traffic Manager
Azure Traffic Manager is a global DNS-based traffic routing service that enables you to distribute traffic across multiple endpoints, including Azure VMs, cloud services, and on-premises resources. It provides automatic failover and load balancing, ensuring that your applications remain available and responsive.

### Monitoring Azure VMs
Azure provides a range of tools for monitoring the performance and health of your VMs. These tools can help you detect issues and troubleshoot problems before they impact your applications.

### Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is a service that provides comprehensive monitoring and logging for Azure resources, including VMs. It enables you to collect and analyze performance metrics, log data, and diagnostic information, and set up alerts and notifications for issues that require attention.

### Azure Advisor
Azure Advisor is a service that provides personalized recommendations for optimizing the performance, security, and reliability of your Azure resources, including VMs. It can help you identify opportunities for cost savings, improve the security of your VMs, and optimize the performance of your applications.

### Azure Diagnostics
Azure Diagnostics is a feature of Azure VMs that enables you to collect and analyze diagnostic information, including performance counters, event logs, and application logs. This information can be used to troubleshoot issues and optimize the performance of your applications.

# Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed the key concepts of managing Azure VMs in Azure Cloud Services, as it pertains to the AZ-104 exam. We have covered topics such as creating and managing VMs, scaling VMs, managing VM availability, and monitoring VMs. By understanding these concepts, you will be well-prepared to take the AZ-104 exam and manage Azure VMs in a real-world environment.
