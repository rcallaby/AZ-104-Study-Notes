# Windows and Linux VMs

Aspiring cloud professionals who are preparing for the Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification exam must be well-versed in creating and managing virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. In particular, they must be familiar with the differences between Windows and Linux VMs in Azure and the considerations that must be taken into account when deploying each of them.

Azure VMs are highly configurable and customizable, providing a wide range of options for deploying both Windows and Linux VMs. In this article, we will discuss the key differences between Windows and Linux VMs in Azure, the requirements for deploying them, and the best practices for managing them.

## Windows VMs in Azure

Windows VMs in Azure are highly configurable, offering a wide range of options for deploying and managing them. They can be deployed using a variety of operating system versions, including Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022, and can be customized with specific configurations and applications to meet the needs of the user.

### To deploy a Windows VM in Azure, the following requirements must be met:

+ An Azure subscription
+ A virtual network with a subnet
+ A storage account
+ A valid Windows Server license or an Azure Hybrid Benefit license

Once these requirements are met, the following steps can be taken to deploy a Windows VM in Azure:

+ Open the Azure Portal and select "Virtual Machines" from the "Create a resource" menu.
+ Select "Windows Server" as the operating system image and choose the appropriate version.
+ Configure the VM by selecting the appropriate size, storage account, virtual network, and subnet.
+ Customize the VM by selecting the appropriate settings, such as disk encryption, backup, and monitoring.
+ Deploy the VM and wait for it to become available.

## Linux VMs in Azure

Linux VMs in Azure are also highly configurable and customizable, providing a wide range of options for deploying and managing them. They can be deployed using a variety of operating system versions, including Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and can be customized with specific configurations and applications to meet the needs of the user.

### To deploy a Linux VM in Azure, the following requirements must be met:

+ An Azure subscription
+ A virtual network with a subnet
+ A storage account
+ An SSH public key
Once these requirements are met, the following steps can be taken to deploy a Linux VM in Azure:

Open the Azure Portal and select "Virtual Machines" from the "Create a resource" menu.
Select the desired Linux distribution as the operating system image and choose the appropriate version.
Configure the VM by selecting the appropriate size, storage account, virtual network, and subnet.
Customize the VM by selecting the appropriate settings, such as disk encryption, backup, and monitoring.
Deploy the VM and wait for it to become available.
Differences between Windows and Linux VMs in Azure

Although Windows and Linux VMs in Azure share many similarities, there are several key differences that must be taken into account when deploying and managing them.

Licensing: Windows VMs require a valid Windows Server license or an Azure Hybrid Benefit license, whereas Linux VMs do not require any additional licensing beyond the cost of the VM itself.

Management: Windows VMs are typically managed using the Windows PowerShell or the Azure portal, whereas Linux VMs are typically managed using the command-line interface or the Azure portal.

Deployment: Windows VMs require a larger footprint than Linux VMs due to the size of the operating system and the additional software required to run Windows applications.

Performance: Linux VMs are typically faster and more efficient than Windows VMs, especially when running in smaller instances.

Best practices for managing Windows and Linux VMs in Azure

To effectively manage Windows and Linux VMs in Azure, it is important to follow best practices that ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. Here are some best practices for managing Windows and Linux VMs in Azure:

Keep your VMs up to date: Regularly update your VMs with the latest patches and security updates to ensure that they are protected against the latest threats.

Monitor performance: Use Azure Monitor to monitor the performance of your VMs and identify potential issues before they become problems.

Implement backup and disaster recovery: Implement a backup and disaster recovery solution to protect your VMs in the event of a failure or disaster.

Optimize costs: Choose the right size for your VMs based on your workload requirements to optimize costs. You can also take advantage of Azure Reserved Instances to reduce costs even further.

Secure your VMs: Implement security best practices such as using strong passwords, enabling encryption, and restricting access to your VMs to ensure that they are secure.

Use automation: Use automation tools such as Azure Automation and PowerShell to automate tasks and improve efficiency.

Follow Azure VM best practices: Follow Azure VM best practices such as using managed disks, optimizing storage performance, and monitoring network traffic to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

Windows and Linux VMs in Azure provide a flexible and customizable platform for deploying and managing virtual machines. Aspiring cloud professionals studying for the AZ-104 exam must be familiar with the differences between Windows and Linux VMs in Azure and the requirements and best practices for deploying and managing them effectively. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your VMs are secure, performant, and cost-effective.
